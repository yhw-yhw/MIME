## MIME: Human-Aware 3D Scene Generation

<img src="data/MIME.gif" alt="drawing" width="720"/>

This repository contains the code and dataset that accompanies our paper [MIME: Human-Aware 3D Scene Generation
](https://mime.is.tue.mpg.de/).

You can find detailed usage instructions for training your own models, using
our pretrained models as well as performing the interactive tasks described in
the paper below.

## Preliminaries
- See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) to install all the required packages and pretrained models.
- See [docs/dataset.md](docs/dataset.md) to download the 3D-FRONT-Human datasets and learn how to add free-space and contact humans inside a 3D room.

### Download the CHECKPOINT and DATA for running the code.

Please download several files from [the download webpage](https://mime.is.tue.mpg.de/login.php).

* Downlad the [MIME_CKPT](https://download.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php?domain=mime&resume=1&sfile=MIME_CKPT.tar.gz) and put it into `data/CKPT`
* Download other needed [code_data](https://download.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php?domain=mime&resume=1&sfile=code_data.tar.gz) and put them into `data`.
* Download 3D-FRONT-HUMAN preprocess data [preprocess_3DFRONTHUMAN_input.tar.gz](https://download.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php?domain=mime&resume=1&sfile=preprocess_3DFRONTHUMAN_input.tar.gz) and unzip into `data/preprocess_3DFRONTHUMAN_input`
* Download our preprocessed [3DFRONTHUMAN_relative_path_pkl.zip](https://download.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php?domain=mime&resume=1&sfile=3DFRONTHUMAN_relative_path_pkl.zip) for 3D-FRONT-Human and unzip into `data/3DFRONTHUMAN_relative_path_pkl`
* Download our preprocess body input [input_finement](https://download.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php?domain=mime&resume=1&sfile=input_refinement.tar.gz) for running scene refinement, unzip it into `data/input_refinement`.
* Download several visualized [samples](https://download.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php?domain=mime&resume=1&sfile=ThreeD-FRONT-HUMAN-samples.tar.gz) in 3D-FRONT-HUMAN for visualization. 

### Change the environment variables.

You need to modify these variables in `env.sh`.

```
# ! need to modify.
export PYTHONPATH=${change_to_python_path}:$PYTHONPATH
export CODE_ROOT_DIR=${change_to_code_path}
export DATA_ROOT_DIR=${change_to_original_3DFRONT_path}
```

## Scene Generation

- See [docs/inference.md](docs/inference.md) to generate scenes from input humans.


## Scene Refinement

- See [docs/refinement.md](docs/refinement.md) to refine the scene layout with gemetrical human-scene interaction details.

## Visualize the Dataset and Results

- See [docs/visualization.md](docs/visualization.md) to visualize the 3D-FRONT-HUMAN dataset and the distribution of different objects locations in our MIME generated results.  

## Training

- See [docs/training.md](docs/train.md) to train your own models.

## Evaluation

- See [docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md) to benchmark your pretrained models.
